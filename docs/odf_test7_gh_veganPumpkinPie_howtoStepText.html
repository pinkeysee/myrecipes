(Save it for smoothies or to pour over cereal.) Transfer the waxy, solidified cream to a deep mixing bowl. Use an electric mixer on medium-high speed to whip it until fluffy. Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract; beat until combined. (NOTE: Some brands of coconut milk might not separate when refrigerated because of the addition of stabilizers and won't whip properly. If that happens, serve it as a sauce rather than as a whipped topping. If you use a canned coconut cream, such as Trader Joe's brand, no refrigeration or separation is required, and it can be whipped as is.)"
