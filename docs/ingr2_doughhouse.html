Cool the gingerbread pieces to room temperature on wire racks. Editor\u2019s Tip: Once the gingerbread pieces have cooled, I like to take a Microplane and gently shave any uneven sides so they\u2019re as sharp and even as possible. It makes assembling so much easier!"

Beat on low speed until stiff peaks form, 5 to 10 minutes. Place a damp cloth over the bowl and cover it tightly between uses. Editor\u2019s Tip: Feel free to decorate the gingerbread house pieces before assembling them. It\u2019s easier to decorate on a flat surface than at a 45- or 90-degree angle. However, it does make assembling a tiny bit trickier, so choose whichever feels best for you."

Align the pieces at a right angle, making sure they are as tight as possible, and place them on a cardboard base. Prop the pieces up with small cans so they keep their shape as the royal icing dries. Pipe icing again along the inside and outside edges for added stability. Repeat these steps with the back wall and the second side wall. Let all four pieces dry completely. Remove the cans. Editor\u2019s Tip: Instead of cans, use a cereal box as a guide to ensure you have a 90-degree angle at the corners of your gingerbread cottage."
