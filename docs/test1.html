I made 2 dozen cookies with them and they were a hit. I made them super soft and gooey. Pull them out of the oven even when they are soft, and let them cool, they will be just the right crispiness on top but soft on the inside. I think I baked my cookies for about 6 or 7 minutes. \n\nGood luck and enjoy!"

Increased peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, added an additional 1/4 cup flour, baked at 350 degrees for 9-10 minutes. After forming the dough into balls, I dipped them in sugar and with sugar side up, gently created a criss-cross pattern on top. The cookies are well balanced--crispy edges, chewy centers. Delicate peanut butter flavor. My whole family loved them!!",

Don't flatten the cookies down too much unless you want a crunchy cookie. Substatute a small amount of oil for butter for a more moist cookie. And of course....add a couple handfulls of chocolate chips! This recipes was really delightful!",

And then a time or two ago, I made the mistake of not creaming the sugars into the butters. Oh noo... Instead, I put all of the dry ingredients, including the sugars, into one container and combined them, and then after creaming the butters and eggs, folded in all the dry at once. It turned out so good, I kept doing like that. Also, I didn't need to cool it off, you can immediately ball it up, fork it down, sprinkle sugar on them, and baked for 9 1/2 minutes. Voila!",

I halved the recipe, and still used a heaped 2/3 cup of peanut butter (smooth peanut butter, not crunchy--and I might try adding even more next time!). I also left the salt amount at 1/2 tsp for a half batch, and added about a teaspoon of vanilla plus a 1/4 tsp almond extract. Whenever my mom and grandma would make peanut butter cookies, they always rolled them in white sugar before baking---so I did the same thing with these, and would do it that way every time! I love the extra little hit of sweetness and crunch that sugar on the outside gives. I got exactly 24 cookies out of a half batch, and they were perfectly baked in 10 minutes. Thank you for sharing your recipe--these cookies are delicious nostalgia!",

            "reviewBody": "I made these for thanksgiving. They spread SO MUCH! I rolled these things absolutely minuscule, smaller than an inch in diameter. They were so sticky, I had to grease my fork to do the criss cross, and that’s after 1 1/2 hours in the fridge. I admit, that may have contributed to the spreading, but when I pulled them out of the oven, they were very puffy and large. I thought, ‘well, they may have spread over the whole sheet, but at least they’re thick!’ NO! They deflated to about two centimetres tall MAX! And what was once less than an inch in diameter expanded to bigger than my palm! The criss cross design was completely gone.However, they taste delicious! The crunchy peanut butter adds a texture I didn’t know I needed! I added a splash of vanilla extract and about 1/2 tsp of cocoa powder. I think next time I’ll add more flour. I baked for 10 minutes, and they came out soft and chewy in the middle with a crunchy border.EDIT: This recipe is a copy of one found on the label of “Kraft Heinz Crunchy peanut butter”, with a few twists such as a changed amount of baking soda, and chilling the dough. Other than that, it is the same. No where here does it say that the recipe is from Kraft. If this is just a coincidence, my apologies for causing confusion.",

I baked these 2 times exactly the way this recipe was written and at best, this recipe gets 2 stars. Cookies came out flat and uninteresting. On the third try I added 1tsp vanilla 1/3 cup more peanut butter and an additional 1/4 cup flour, then put in the freezer for 20 minutes (because I didn't have time to put in fridge). Baked at 375 for 10 minutes. Still not perfect, but better. The last 10 cookies I added some chocolate chips. Better. I think I will keep searching for that perfect recipe though.",
